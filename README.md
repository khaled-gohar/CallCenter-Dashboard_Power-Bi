- 📊 Show **total offered calls per skill (monthly view)**  
- 📊 Compare **AHT per language by quarter**  
- 📊 Show **answered calls % by skill**  
- 📊 Compare **AHT for Arabic & English teams** using a **boxplot chart** and provide insights  
- 📊 Calculate **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)** and **FCR (First Call Resolution)**, and analyze their relationship

## 📂 Data Collection & Preparation

The data was provided in CSV format via email and then:  
- Cleaned and transformed in **Power BI**  
- A **Calendar table** was created to improve data modeling and time-based analysis
